    "# Checking Regression Models\n",
    "Today, we’re going to learn how to fit a model to data and how to make sure we haven’t violated any of the underlying assumptions. We're going to practice fitting a regression model to our data and examining the residuals to see if our model is a good representation of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Residuals\n",
    "A residual is just how far off a model is for a single point. So if our model predicts that a 20 pound cantaloupe should sell for eight dollars and it actually sells for ten dollars, the residual for that data point would be two dollars. Most models will be off by at least a little bit for pretty much all points, but you want to make sure that there’s not a strong pattern in your residuals because that suggests that your model is failing to capture some underlying trend in your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Kaggle data science survey\n",
    "For our example today, we're going to use the Kaggle we’re going to use the 2017 Kaggle ML and Data Science Survey. I’m interested in seeing if we can predict the salary of data scientists based on their age. My intuition is that older data scientists, who are probably more experienced, will have higher salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because salary is a count value (you're usually paid in integer increments of a unit of currency, and hopefully you shouldn't be being paid a negative amount), we're going to model this with a Poisson regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we train a model, however, we need to set up our environment. I'm going to read in two datasets: the Kaggle Data Science Survey for the example and the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for you to work with."
